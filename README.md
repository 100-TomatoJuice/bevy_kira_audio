# Bevy improved audio

This bevy plugin is intended as an easy way to test improvements for `bevy_audio`. The initial code is from the current implementation of `bevy_audio` and thus `Copyright (c) 2020 Carter Anderson`. You can find bevy's [MIT license here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/master/LICENSE) .

## To do
- [x] pause/resume and stop tracks
- [] play a track on repeat
- [] get the current status of a track (time elapsed/left)?
- [] web support
  - It is currently possible to get sound for web when building with the `web` feature, BUT the sound is quite laggy...
